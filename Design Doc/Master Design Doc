Project: Build a "Pocket Bunny" virtual pet game for a 4-year-old.

Tech Stack:

Create a single index.html file that contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

No external assets (use Emojis for graphics).

No external sound files (synthesize cute beep/boop/crunch sounds using the standard Web Audio API).

Visual Layout:

Center: A massive, animated Bunny Emoji (🐰) in the middle of the screen.

Background: A soft, pastel "meadow green" gradient.

Controls: A row of 3 giant circular buttons at the bottom.

🥕 Carrot (Feed)

🖐️ Hand (Pet/Tickle)

🌙 Moon (Sleep)

Interactions & Logic:

Feeding: When the Carrot button is tapped, the Bunny should bounce up and down, and a "Crunch" sound should play. Little heart particles should float up.

Petting: When the Hand button (or the Bunny itself) is tapped, the Bunny should wiggle/shake, and a high-pitched "Giggle" sound should play.

Sleeping: When the Moon button is tapped, toggle "Night Mode." The background turns dark blue, the Bunny changes to a "Sleeping Face" emoji (😴), and 'Zzz' particles float up. A soft lullaby chord plays.

Kids Mode Requirements (Crucial):

Touch Handling: Use touchstart listeners to ensure it feels responsive on an iPad/Tablet.

Lock Down: Add CSS to body to prevent scrolling, zooming, or text selection (user-select: none, touch-action: none). It needs to feel like a native app, not a website.

Animations: Use CSS transitions for everything. The buttons should squash/squeeze when pressed (juice).
